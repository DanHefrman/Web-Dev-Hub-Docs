# Creating an API

## Creating an API

To start using the API Builder, you can create a new API in your workspace. You can also rename or delete existing APIs.

### Creating an API <a id="creating-an-api"></a>

1. Open **APIs** from the left sidebar in Postman. You can open and edit any existing APIs from here.
2. Select **New**, then select **API** or select **+**.

   > You must be signed in to your Postman account to take this action.

3. Enter a name and a version, then select a schema type and format for your API. You can optionally select the **Import** tab to import an API specification directly from either a local file or a GitHub or Bitbucket repo. If you don't import a schema, Postman will populate your API with a sample specification you can edit at any time.

   > Postman currently supports OpenAPI \(versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\), RAML \(0.8 and 1.0\), GraphQL, or WSDL \(1.1 and 2.0\) schemas. OpenAPI schemas can be defined in JSON or YAML. RAML schemas must be YAML. GraphQL schemas can be JSON or GraphQL SDL. WSDL schemas must be XML. Multi-file variants of schemas are currently not supported.

### Renaming and deleting APIs <a id="renaming-and-deleting-apis"></a>

You can rename, delete, or remove the API from the workspace using the **View more actions** \(![Three dots icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg)\) menu in the left sidebar.

> When you delete an API or remove it from a workspace, the collections, monitors, mocks, and environments linked to it will not be deleted or removed.
